Business Understanding
The Titanic dataset offers a unique opportunity to explore survival patterns from one of history’s most infamous maritime disasters. This analysis aims to answer key questions:

What percentage of passengers perished, and how did gender influence survival?

What were the financial consequences of the sinking?

Can data science help us understand the social dynamics aboard the Titanic?

By examining these questions, we uncover not just historical facts, but insights into human behavior and decision-making under crisis.

📊 Data Understanding
The dataset used in this project is manually aggregated and includes:

Total death counts

Gender-specific death counts

Estimated financial fallout in millions USD

No missing values are present, and the data is structured for direct analysis. While simplified, this dataset captures essential dimensions of the tragedy and allows for meaningful exploration.

🧹 Data Preparation
Since the dataset is pre-aggregated, no cleaning was required. All values are complete and formatted for analysis. This allowed us to focus on interpretation and visualization rather than preprocessing.

📈 Evaluation
The visualizations reveal stark gender disparities in survival:

80% of the deceased were male, highlighting the “women and children first” evacuation protocol.

Financial losses were highest in insurance payouts, followed by legal claims and fleet changes.

These findings align with historical accounts and underscore the human and economic toll of the disaster.

📣 Communication
This analysis will be published on Medium to reach a broad audience. Key takeaways include:

Gender played a decisive role in survival outcomes.

The Titanic’s sinking had ripple effects across industries and legal systems.

Data science can illuminate historical events in new and powerful ways.

Future work could expand this analysis by incorporating class-based survival rates, age distributions, or predictive modeling using the full Titanic dataset from Kaggle.


Perfect — here’s a polished introduction and conclusion you can add to your Medium post or notebook. It complements your existing narrative and analysis while tying everything together with clarity and impact:

✨ Introduction
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most haunting tragedies of the 20th century. Beyond the icy waters and shattered dreams lies a story told not just through history books, but through data. This project uses the Titanic dataset to explore who was aboard, who survived, and what the aftermath looked like — both in human and financial terms.

By analyzing aggregated data, we aim to uncover patterns in survival rates, particularly across gender, and estimate the economic fallout of the disaster. This isn’t just a technical exercise; it’s a way to understand how privilege, protocol, and circumstance shaped the fate of over 2,200 passengers.

🧠 Conclusion
The Titanic dataset reveals more than numbers — it tells a story of inequality, sacrifice, and consequence. Our analysis shows that 80% of the deceased were male, a reflection of the “women and children first” policy. Financial losses were steep, with insurance payouts leading the economic fallout.

These insights, while rooted in a historical event, remind us of the human dimensions behind data. They show how decisions made in moments of crisis can echo across generations. As data scientists, we have the tools to illuminate these stories — and the responsibility to tell them well.
