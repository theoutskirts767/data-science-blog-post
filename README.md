# Titanic data analysis 
A data science project about the Titanic and who was on board the vessel.

The grand voyage of the RMS Titanic began from Southampton, England on April 10 1912. It was a floating palace bound for New York City. Everyone called it "unsinkable" and the lavish ship was a masterpiece of the Gilded Age, a testament to human innovation.  Aboard were some of the richest and most famous people in the world. John Jacob Astor IV, a millionaire magnate, was there with his much younger wife, Madeleine. Industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim, whose last moments were spent in his finest evening clothes, and Isidor Straus, the co-owner of Macy's, with his devoted wife Ida, who refused to leave his side. The shipâ€™s short journey across the icy Atlantic was a series of grand balls and lavish meals, a world of privilege sailing on the surface of danger. But on the night of April 14, a massive iceberg appeared in the darkness. The unimaginable happened. The great ship struck the ice and sank in the frigid waters in just a few hours. Over 2,200 souls on board, the final death toll was more than 1,500.
