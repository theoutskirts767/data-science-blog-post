This repository walks through how we transformed a century-old tragedy into modern insights for insurers, cruise operators, and regulators. You’ll find the data, a Jupyter notebook with all the code and visualizations, and the blog post that tells the full story.

Project Overview
This analysis answers five stakeholder questions using the uploaded CSV:

Does ticket class predict survival?

Is traveling with family an advantage?

How much did age matter?

Did embarkation port sway odds?

Are high fares tied to higher survival?

The notebook generates bar charts, pivot tables, and everything needed to back up each percentage and conclusion.
