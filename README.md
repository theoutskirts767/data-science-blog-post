# Water Technology in Rome
A data science project about Water Technology in ancient Rome.

I'm writing about ancient Roman water technology systems because it is a great example of how one piece of technology didn't just solve a problem; it completely reshaped the entire society. It's a reminder of how innovation has shaped a great empire like Rome and how it has even evolved into the way we use water systems today in modern-day society.
